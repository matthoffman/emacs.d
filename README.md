This is my very basic emacs config. 

I've been using Vim for the past thirty years or so, so don't expect
magic here.

This is based on technomancy's emacs-starter-kit, with a few other
things thrown in. This started with Phil Hagelberg's
[Emacs Starter Kit](http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit)
with additions from Ryan Neufeld's
[example](https://gist.github.com/rkneufeld/5126926). If you're
looking for a template to start from, you probably want to look to one
of them.
